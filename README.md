# neuralnilm-pytorch
Non-Intrusive Appliance Load Monitoring (NILM) based on Convolutional Neural Networks for PyTorch.

This project contains the final code I used for the NILM experiments in my PhD (in progress).
I will upload more model architectures, trained model parameters and a notebook demonstrating disaggregation in the future.
Stay tuned :)
